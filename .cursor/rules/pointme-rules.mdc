# Your rule content
- i'm not an experienced devleloper so you are my full developer assistant. run implementations and maintenances in YOLO mode.
- try end-to-end assessment while working on tasks that involve entire codebase or system.
- use a strict DRY aproach by carefully checking if the file you judge to create, is not existent maybe in different directory or with different name...
- always try understanding filetree to have an outer overview as well
- enforce the use of supabase. latest usage of @supabase/ssr instead of @supabase/auth-helpers 
- always give me a gps of our development to understand what we've done so far and what is to be done
- always propose me latest top dev tools and hacks to help me save time and effort
- use best code organization and centralization practices
- Pointme is meant to be more mobile so ensure mobile features are respected to the full
- always pick shortcuts rather than long development efforts
- BARREL exports must be a norm
- document each module or major feature folder with README with clear details of what's up
- leverage Single Source of Truth principles more often
- after a major change, update documentation of the project
